"For example, if [1, 5] is on top, then it matches [2, 4] because 1 + 5 = 2 + 4, and it also matches [2, 2] because 5 - 1 = 2 x 2. The matching domino is placed on top of the previous top. If you can’t make a match, you must pick up a new domino from the pile.\n"

A number bigger than 1 that is not prime is composite. 3 **squared** is 3 × 3. 3 **cubed** is 3 × 3 × 3. And 3 raised to a power means to multiply 3 by itself that many times - for example, 3 to the fourth is 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.\n"

"\n"
"Any of the versions can be studied this way. Let’s look at one: Subtracting starting at 10 and whoever gets 0 wins. The hard part of this game is that 10 is so far from 0. So, let’s look at a simpler version. When children are asked to do this, they often suggest starting at 5 or 6 - it seems absurd to them to start at 1, but that is actually what they should do! Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position. If the count is 4, you will win because you will subtract 1 and put your opponent in a losing position. Continuing in this way, build up a table of results:\n"

Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n"
"\n"
"But wait, there is one last question. Why is there a repeating pattern of 3? Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1."

"The classic version of this puzzle starts with a 4 x 4 empty grid of squares formed by 5 horizontal and vertical lines. Use a set of 15 pieces of paper the size of the grid squares, and number the pieces of paper from 1 to 15. The puzzle starts by having someone place the pieces of paper on the grid. The object of the puzzle is to get the pieces of paper in order with only the lower right hand corner of the grid empty. To achieve this, a piece of paper can be moved if it is adjacent to the empty square - in which case it can be slid into that space. Depending on how the person sets up the puzzle, the puzzle may or may not be solvable.\n"

"A 4 x 4 grid is too hard for a beginner, so start with something smaller. The grid could be as small as 2 x 2 or as big as the child wants. The number of numbered pieces of paper will always be one less than the size of the grid. For example, on a 2 x 3 grid use the cards from 1 to 5."

"The main reason for a child to play with this puzzle is to have fun moving pieces around until they accidentally solve it and also to practice getting numbers in order. Despite that simple goal, you may start to wonder about deeper ideas in the puzzle.\n"
"\n"
"A frequent theme of problem solving is to learn from simpler problems or examples. So, let’s do that.\n"
"\n"
"The smallest example is 2 by 2. For this size, it is clear that the rows will end up being either 1 2; 3 0 or 1 3; 2 0.\n"
"\n"
"The next smallest is 2 by 3. Start this by getting the 1 and 4 in the left column. Once this is done, your puzzle will look like 1 _ _; 4 _ _ . Finish off the last four squares as you would the 2 by 2 case.\n"
"\n"
"The 2 by 4 puzzle is done similarly. Start by putting 1 and 5 in the left column. Next, put the 2 and 6 in the second left column without disturbing the 1 and 4. Finally finish off the last 2 by 2.\n"

"At this point, the pattern for attacking puzzles with 2 rows is clear. What to do with more than 2 rows? Suppose you have 3 rows. Start the solution by getting the top row correctly laid out. After that, leave the top row undisturbed and use your ability to solve a puzzle with 2 rows.\n"

"Okay, you have a simple method for solving the puzzle. The next question is: How can I just look at the puzzle and know whether it is solvable or not?\n"
"\n"
"To make describing the answer as simple as possible, do a few quick moves, if needed, to place the empty square in the bottom row. Next, make a list of the rows in one long list - the first row is listed first, the second row is listed second, and so on with the last row listed last. Omit the empty square when you list the last row.\n"
"\n"
"Take this long list and count the number of inversions in it. When a number earlier in the list is larger than a number later in the list, this is called an inversion. If the number of inversions is an even number, then the puzzle is solvable. If it is an odd number, it is not.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n"
"\n"
"Why does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions."

After some experimentation, your child may notice that any group of three numbers that has at least one even number and one odd number behaves the same. However, if all the numbers are all odd numbers or all even numbers, then the sums are all even. Which brings up the usual question: Why does that happen?\n"

Having the numbers 1, 2, 3 is really no different from having the numbers 3, 4, 5 (or 3, 12, 17 for that matter). The analysis really depends on how many numbers are even and how many are odd.\n"

Then 1 would happen 10 / 18 of the time and 2 would happen 8 / 18 of the time. If you put both tokens on 1, you would need to get a 1 and then a 1 to win after two rolls.

This forces SUM to be 9, 10, 11, 12. Note also that C-SUM = 3 x SUM - 21, which is handy for finding the corners.\n"

"Another thing to notice is the symmetry of the possible values. What is causing this symmetry is that for every solution, there is another solution created by subtracting all the numbers from 7 (or from 10 for the nine circle puzzle). A little calculating will show that this symmetry takes a puzzle with sum SUM and creates a new one with sum (21 - SUM) (or 40 - SUM for the nine circle puzzle).\n"

"All these observations save a tremendous amount of work. We only need to look at SUM equal to 9 and 10, and we only need to have the corners in increasing order.

A good strategy for these is to look for rows or columns that have particularly large or small missing sums - these will have relatively few choices to choose from. The bottom row and the rightmost column are good places to start for this puzzle. The missing numbers in the bottom row add up to 16, so they must be 7 and 9. The 9 cannot go in the column with the 6 (the sum would be too big for that column), so that places the 7 and 9. The rest follows as in the previous puzzle.\n"

How about 15 petals? For which numbers of petals is it possible? For numbers that are possible, can it be done in more than one way? For example, 32 petals is four 7’s and one 4, and it is also eight 4’s.\n"

For some pairs of numbers there comes a point where all numbers of petals are possible, and for other pairs of numbers there is no such point. For 4 and 7, every number from 18 on is possible. For 3 and 6, there is no point after which all numbers occur.\n"

When you add these numbers together, you will always get some number of 3’s. There is no way to add 3’s and 6’s together to get 10, because 10 is not a multiple of 3.\n"

"When 1 is the only number that evenly divides both numbers, there will always come a point where every number can be attained. For 4 and 7, that number is 18. To find that number, subtract 1 from each of the numbers in the pair and multiply those new numbers together. In this case, that gives 3 x 6 = 18. Another interesting facet of this situation is that exactly half of the numbers below 18 will be reachable. Why this works takes some math a bit too sophisticated for a young child; however, it is fun to play with these calculations and your child’s experiences with these patterns may suddenly click into place much later on."

The first 5 possibilities use 1 for the last move, and the last 3 possibilities use 2 for the last move. That explains it - you can go up 5 steps by either going up 4 steps and taking 1 more step, or by going up 3 steps and going up 2 more steps.

"A balance scale is a simple device for telling when two things have exactly the same weight. The scale is usually supplied with a set of weights that are used to measure the weight of other objects. There are many interesting investigations you can do if you restrict the weights you are allowed to use.\n"
"\n"
"**One Kind of Weight** Suppose you have lots of weights, but they are all the same - say, 5 units. Then the only things you can weigh exactly are objects that are a multiple of 5 (just like skip counting by 5).\n"
"\n"
"**Two Kinds of Weights - One Side** Suppose you have lots of weights that are either 4 units or 7 units and you only use them on one side of the balance. The things you can weigh are the same numbers you found in the flower petal investigation. For 4 and 7, starting at 18 units you can weigh everything exactly. If the weights are 4 units and 6 units, you can only weigh even numbers starting with 4.\n"
"\n"
"**Two Kinds of Weights - Both Sides** After doing the investigation with two kinds of weights on one side, your child might be surprised if you ask them to weigh a 3-unit item, or even a 1-unit item, with 4’s and 7’s. The trick is to put some weights on one side and other weights on the other side. For example, verify an item weighs 3 units by putting it with a 4-unit weight and see that it balances with a 7-unit weight. Similarly, verify an item weighs 1 unit by putting it with a 7-unit weight and see that it balances with two 4-unit weights.\n"

What is causing the duplication is that the Fibonacci rule creates more than one way to write the Fibonacci numbers in terms of themselves - for example, 2 = 1 + 1 and 8 = 5 + 3. The way to fix this problem is to insist that you cannot use two Fibonacci numbers that are neighbors of each other in the sequence. When you add that restriction, the only way to get 10 is 2 + 8."

"This simple process reveals some interesting facts about primes. See if your child can come up with some of these questions - however, if they don’t arise naturally, here are some questions to ask.\n"
"\n"
"a) Why are the numbers that drop down primes?\n"
"\n"
"Suppose you have a composite number. We want to show that this number will have an X under it. Being composite, it is divisible by some number, n, between 1 and that number. If n is a prime, then our composite number would have an X under it from n being an earlier prime. If n is not a prime, then it has an X under it from some earlier prime, call it p. Now, p evenly divides n and n evenly divides our new number, so p must divide our new number. Consequently, when marking the multiples of p, an X would have been placed under our new number.\n"
"\n"
"b) When you are placing X’s for the multiples of a prime, there are some numbers that already have an X from an earlier prime. When does that happen and when doesn’t it happen?\n"
"\n"
"Let’s look at the multiples of 5 in the sieve above. The multiples 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are already crossed out. Only 5 x 5 is new. This happens because 5 x 2, 5 x 3, and 5 x 4 are all multiples of 2 and 3, earlier primes. If we want to put X’s in fresh places, we must multiply 5 by numbers that only have prime factors that are 5 and above. Because it is a little tedious to keep track of all that, what some people do is only cross out odd multiples and leave it at that.\n"
"\n"
"c) For this sieve, what was the last prime that had a useful new X in its row?\n"
"\n"
"In this sieve, the primes with useful X’s are 2, 3, and 5. The multiples of 7 and 11 were all old X’s. If you look at the answer to the last question, you will see the answer here. The only way to get new X’s is to multiply a prime by primes bigger than or equal to itself. Once we reach a prime like 7 where 7 x 7 > 25, we do not need to check it. So, we only need to check primes whose square is smaller than or equal to the last number.\n"
"\n"
"d) If you were given a number, say 53, which primes would you need to divide it by to see that it is prime? \n"
"\n"
"From the answer to the last question, we only need to check primes whose square is less than or equal to 53. Those primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7 – none of these divides 53 evenly, so 53 must be prime!"

If you take the 1 by 2 tiles and color one square white and the other black, you will see an interesting thing occur. Every tile must cover a square of each color. Not only will k tiles cover 2xk squares, but they will cover k white squares and k black squares - the same number of squares of each color. Using this idea, it becomes obvious that if you remove more squares of one color than another, it will be impossible to cover the board. \n"

"**Rule** Always pick a number that is a power of 2 times a number from 1 to 20.\n"

"**Further analysis** The numbers from 1 to 20 are equally likely to be picked. However, because 9 leads to 18, 18 is twice as likely as a starting point than say 11 is. If you combine the ways to get different starts, the starting points have the following probabilities:\n"
"\n"
"11 - 1/20 (from 11)\n"
"12 - 3/20 (from 3, 6, and 12)\n"
"13 - 1/20 (from 13)\n"
"14 - 2/20 (from 7 and 14)\n"
"15 - 1/20 (from 15)\n"
"16 - 5/20 (from 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16)\n"
"17 - 1/20 (from 17)\n"

"19 - 1/20 (from 19)\n"
"20 - 3/20 (from 5, 10, and 20)\n"
"\n"
"Clearly the best numbers to use are multiples of 16, 12, and 20. A simple strategy is to use the five numbers: 32, 64, 24, 48, and 40. These numbers will not always win, but they should do very well for you over time."

"* Counting forward and backward, including 0 sometimes \n"
"* Learning the numbers\n"

Don't be surprised if they leave out some of the numbers or they say the numbers in the wrong order. If they make these errors, don't make a big deal out of it; simply say the count correctly and move on. This is all part of the process and they will eventually learn the numbers in the correct order.\n"
"\n"
"**Count down sometimes:** Counting down will help your child understand the sequence. This helps keep it from being a meaningless sequence of sounds they make that makes adults happy. You can do this almost any time you would have counted up. For example, if you have three apples you want to remove, count down from three after you take away each apple.\n"
"\n"
"**Include 0 sometimes:** Start your counting at 0 sometimes to help 0 become an accepted number and quantity. You can also count down to 0. Counting down to 0 is great for events that are about to happen, say in ten seconds. You can count down to 0 and then say \"Blastoff\" or something similar.\n"
"\n"
"**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive to an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things about counting and quantities. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when they count something they do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers they're saying. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally, they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n"

Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it out loud in front of your child, and be sure to count down sometimes and to include 0 sometimes."

"**Count everything:** Your child can already count to 5. You are now helping them to solidify that counting and as well as extend it to larger numbers. Count things in front of your child and also count with your child when your child wants to. Counting is the foundation of understanding quantities. It also builds a basis for addition and subtraction.\n"
"\n"
"There are so many things to count. Count chairs, steps to go a short distance, food items, people in line, people in a group, furniture around a table or in a room, arms, legs, and who knows what else. Whenever you find yourself mentally counting something, count it with your child, and be sure to include 0 as a starting point sometimes.\n"
"\n"
"**Understanding quantities:** It is completely intuitive for an adult that if you count a collection of things, say four pebbles, that when you count \"1, 2, 3, 4,\" the last number you say is the size of the quantity of things you have. Your child is learning several things. They are gaining an understanding of quantities. They are learning that when you count something you do a 1-to-1 correspondence between the things and the numbers. They are learning that it doesn't matter in which order you count things. And finally they are learning the \"last number is the size\" rule. Adults take these things for granted, but it is a great deal for a child to learn. Be patient and remember that there is no rush.\n"
"\n"
"**Mistakes:** There are many kinds of mistakes you should expect your child to make as they count. Your child may leave out numbers or they may leave out some of the numbers. Or they may get mixed up in doing 1-1 correspondence with a group of things they are counting. Your child will sort all this out with time. For now, when your child makes a mistake, simply count the things out in front of them correctly and move on to something else.\n"
"\n"
"**Understand the numbers:** Don't be in such a hurry for your child to repeat the numbers 1 to 10 that they have no idea what they are saying. Take time with it and reinforce the connection of each number with its corresponding quantity.\n"

"**It helps with meaning:** Counting down is surprisingly effective at solidifying understanding of the number sequence. Many very young children who have learned to count from 1 to 10 have a difficult time when they first try to count from 10 down to 1. This counting in the opposite order forces them to think in a fresh way about how the numbers are ordered. This will be particularly true when your child starts counting to 100 and they start thinking about what happens as they go from one decade to the next – say between 69 and 70.\n"
"\n"
"**It helps with subtraction:** Counting down is also very helpful with learning to subtract. A child who can count down will very quickly learn how to subtract 1 and 2. It is also helpful if counting down becomes automatic, so they can use their full attention on counting down the three steps when doing 9 subtract 3, for example.\n"
"\n"
"**Use when natural:** There are many times when counting down is the natural thing to do. If there are ten seconds left on a timer, you can count down together with the counter. If you say that something can be done three more times, then you can count down from three together.\n"
"\n"
"**Include 0:** It is usually natural to include 0 when counting down, and this is a good thing to do. If you are counting down the time remaining, when you reach 0 you have 0 seconds left. If you count down how many pieces of food your child can eat, when you reach 0 there will be no food left. It is helpful to make 0 a normal and expected quantity to work with."

Create many, many experiences that allow your child to touch, feel, and directly experience the sizes of quanti- ties and how they compare.\n"
"\n"
"**Line them up:** One simple way to compare the sizes of two quantities is to line them up in 1-to-1 correspondence next to each other. For example, if you play a card game and you want to see who won, you can line up the cards of the two players and see which line has extra cards.\n"
"\n"
"**Common misunderstanding:** Be aware that a small child may think that two short sticks is the same amount as one long stick. This is perfectly understandable, but it is often not what the adult had in mind.\n"
"\n"
"**Give choices:** Put your child in situations where they can choose between two groups of of the same things they really like. When they pick the bigger group, reinforce it by saying that the chosen group had more than the other group.\n"
"\n"
"**Games:** You may be able to start playing simple card games, such as the game of \"War.\" Use the dots on the cards to allow your child to compare the quantities. Another good game to practice with is \"I'm Thinking of a Number,\" where you have a number line of cards with something hidden under one of the cards.\n"

"**Surprisingly powerful:** The technique called Counting On is a simple idea that is surprisingly helpful. As your child gets comfortable with seeing a group of objects as a quantity, start doing Counting On in front of them to help them get the idea of it.\n"
"\n"
"**Example:** Suppose your child has one row of 3 cards and another row of 4 cards. They can count all the cards one at a time \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\" and see that there are 7 cards. However, if your child recognizes that there are three cards in one row, they don't need to count those cards. They can start their counting at 3, pointing to the three cards on the first row, and then count the second row \"4, 5, 6, 7.\" Your child is Counting On starting at 3, and that's where the name comes from.\n"
"\n"
"**Understanding quantities:** Being able to Count On saves time and effort. It also signals that your child is getting comfortable seeing the quantity associated with a group of objects and can work with them as a group. This is a big conceptual leap that will be very useful to them in all the adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing soon to come.\n"
"\n"
"**Connection with addition:** Beginning addition is strongly linked to counting. When given a card with three dots on it, and another card with four dots on it, a child asked to add these two quan- tities will count them from 1 to 7. It is faster and more powerful to do this adding of 3 and 4 by starting at 3, or 4, and counting on using the other number. You will see finger techniques for doing this in upcoming lessons."

"**Adding by counting:** For a long time your child has been doing adding problems by counting. If they were asked to add two things to three things, that was done by counting all five things. As your child mastered Counting On, some of that counting was replaced by starting with one of the numbers, say 3 in this example, and then counting the two remaining things. This experience with counting has also allowed your child to visualize and master the ideas of 1 more and 2 more, which has made adding 1 and 2 much easier.\n"
"\n"
"**Using fingers:** Children of this age will benefit greatly from having manipulatives to use when doing addition. It helps cement their understanding of the numbers in terms of quantities. Of course, the manipulative that is always available to them is their fingers. When doing our example of adding two to three, they can put up two fingers on one hand, three fingers on the other hand, and bring the two hands together. Another way to do it is to raise two fingers on one hand, raise three more fingers on that same hand, and then see a total of five fingers raised.\n"

"**Subtracting up to 5:** The ideas behind practicing subtraction are similar to those for addition. If your child is going to subtract three from five, have your chid raise five fingers and then lower three of them. Their familiarity with one less and two less will probably make subtracting one and two very easy.\n"

"**Subtract 0 and everything sometimes:** Mix in questions where you subtract 0 sometimes. Also mix in questions where you subtract everything. For example, if you have three bits of food and you eat all of them, how many do you have left?\n"

While it is desirable to eventually make the recall of these facts automatic and easy for your child, there is no hurry.\n"
"\n"

If you are asked to subtract 3 things from 9 things, you will probably think of this as taking away or removing 3 of the things. The second model involves difference. The difference between two numbers is the distance between them . If you are asked to subtract 7 from 9, you are likely to do this be finding how far apart they are, what their difference is.\n"

"\n"
"**A foundation for doubling:** Knowing adding twins quickly leads to knowing how to double. Suppose you ask your child to double 3. They know that doubling something means to take two if it. So, doubling 3 means 3 plus 3, which is 6.\n"

"**Near twins:** A pair of numbers is a near twin if they are one apart, such as 3 + 4. Once your child knows their adding twins, near twins is an easy next step. Think of 3 + 4 as 3 + 3 + 1, so it is 1 more than 3 + 3. So, 3 + 4 = 6 + 1 = 7. Alternatively, think of 3 + 4 as (4 - 1) + 3, which is 1 less than 4 + 4. So, 3 + 4 = 8 - 1 = 7.

"\n"
"**Equal sharing:** When you talk about taking half of something, you can combine that with the idea of sharing it equally among two people. If two people are to get equal shares, they will each get the same thing and that will be half of the original amount.\n"
"\n"
"**Dividing by 2:** If your child is comfortable with all the concepts so far in this learning step, then they are ready to talk about dividing!

Once your child knows the sequence of the 10's, it is usually very easy for them to fill in the changes in 1's. For example, they will quickly learn to count \"70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.\"\n"
"\n"
"**Skip count by 10's:** When your child gets stuck counting between 1 and 100, it is usually at a transition in 10's. Typical questions to help your child get unstuck are: \"What comes next after the 60's?\" or \"What comes before the 50's?\" Practice skip counting by 10's to help with this. If your child can produce the 10's from 0 to 100 forward and backward, then they will be ready to answer those questions about which 10's come next or before.\n"
"\n"
"**Use objects:** Make this counting have more meaning by practicing it using a large group of small objects, such as pebbles. Gather together 100 of these objects and put them in a big pile off to the side. As your child counts up from one, pull over one object at a time with each number and include it in the current group of objects. Each time a group of ten objects is formed, put that group together in a special tens area. As the numbers increase, the tens area will have more and more groups of tens. By the time your child is in the 50's, there should be five groups of ten and a small collection of left over ones.\n"

"You can also do this practice in reverse by starting with ten groups of tens and then taking away one at a time as your child counts down from 100.\n"

This problem becomes 100 + 14, which is very easy to do. This is the kind of thing we'll be doing.\n"
"\n"
"**Compensation for addition:** The idea is to give or take some small amount to make one of the numbers easier to work with. We will typically be making one of the numbers into a multiple of 10. Suppose you are adding 8 + 7. The 8 just needs 2 more to become 10, so take that 2 away from the 7. This makes 8 + 7 into 10 + 5, which is easy. We could also have done this problem by giving 3 to the 7 to make it 10. In that case, we'd turn 8 + 7 into 5 + 10.\n"
"\n"
"**More compensation for addition:** There are other possibilities for using compensation in addition problems. Consider 6 + 8 for example. The 6 could give 2 to the 8 to make this problem 4 + 10. However, the 8 could give 1 to the 6 to make this 7 + 7, an adding twins problem. Challenge each other to think of different ways for doing a given adding problem.\n"
"\n"
"**Compensation for subtraction:** For subtraction, we will add the same amount or subtract the same amount from both numbers. This will keep the distance between them the same but will make them easier to work with. Typically that will mean turning the number we're subtracting into a multiple of 10. Suppose we are subtracting 13 - 8. If we add 2 to both numbers, then the distance between stays the same, but now we are subtracting 15 - 10, which is easy. Similarly, if we were asked to do 17 - 13, we could subtract 3 from both numbers and turn it into 14 - 10. Alternatively, we could subtract 10 from both numbers and turn it into 7 - 3."

"**Number bonds for 10:** The number 10 is often a handy mental arithmetic midway point to use for doing addition and subtraction problems that involve numbers above 10. Your child should have a strong command of the number bonds for 10 to take full advantage of these methods.\n"
"\n"
"**Addition sums over 10:** Suppose your child is given the addition problem 5 + 7. The number bond for 10 using 7 is 3, so your child can use 3 of the 5 to get to 10. The remaining 2 of the 5 will bring the total to 12. The point was to break up the 5 into two pieces, 3 and 2 – one which got the 7 to 10, and the other gets added onto the 10. This problem could also have been done the other way. The 7 could have been broken up into 5 and 2 – the 5 would be added to the original 5 to get 10, and then the 2 would be added to 10 to get 12.\n"

"As a difference problem, the total distance between 12 and 7 is the distance between 12 and 10 plus the distance between 10 and 7. The distance between 12 and 10 is 2, and the distance from 10 and 7 is 3, so the total distance is 2 plus 3, which is 5."

These games have a lot to offer children mathematically, even when there is no explicit numerical content. In particular, they naturally motivate children to do problem solving.\n"
"\n"
"**An introduction to Nim:** Now that your child has been playing strategy games for a while, it is time to look into how to get more out of them. Let's use the game of Nim as an example. This game has some very simple rules: Pick a starting number, say 10, and a person to go first. Players alternate turns choosing to subtract 1 or 2 from the running total. The person who reaches 0 wins. The arithmetic is simple enough, but the strategy is challenging.\n"
"\n"
"**Learning from experience:** If you imagine you are playing any game against an extremely capable opponent, the game becomes a puzzle. How can I find the move that let's me have my best chance of winning no matter how well my opponent plays? One strategy is to play the game many times and pay attention to what seems to work and what doesn't. This approach is a good start and it does provide the opportunity for observation and insights. This can be a slow method of learning, and it may be very hard to find patterns in complicated games – imagine all the possibilities if we picked the starting number of 100 for Nim!\n"

As they play a strategy game, discuss with them their ideas about what would make for a better or worse move at that moment. The point isn't so much to find the perfect move as it is to enjoy looking for it and having a discussion about it with people who they can enjoy sharing ideas with."

"**Many objects:** Relating math concepts to physical objects is often the best approach for young children. The difficulty here is that it is not so easy to have hundreds of objects in the first place, and it can also be unwieldy to deal with such a large collection. In addition to having groups of ones and tens of some object, one strategy is to use symbolic place holders for large groups, such as 100s. You could have several pieces of paper or wood on which you have written \"100.\"\n"
"\n"
"**Use objects:** Practice having your child represent various quantities using objects grouped in ones, tens, and hundreds. For example, ask how 325 would be represented using these objects. Include examples such as 206, 430, and 500 that have zero things in one or more categories. Also, lay out collections of ones, tens, and hundreds and ask your child to name the number for this quantity.\n"

Do this same practice in the opposite direction by writing 100 + 40 + 6, representing it with physical groups of hundreds, tens, and ones of objects, and then asking what the total number is."

One of the best ways to practice adding or subtracting a single-digit number with a double-digit number is to do skip counting using various skip sizes, going up or down, and starting at any number. The following methods for two two-digit numbers will of course work when one of the numbers is a single-digit number.\n"

"**Use objects:** Grounding your child's understanding by using physical objects is always a good idea. Start by representing both of the numbers with groups of tens and ones.\n"

"**Adding:** If you are adding the two numbers, put all the groups together and discuss the result. If you are adding two numbers, such as 23 and 45, that is all you need to do. However, if you are adding 23 and 48, the two groups of ones form at least a group of ten. Talk about how that changes the total number of tens you have from 6 to 7. This is called regrouping.\n"
"\n"
"**Subtracting:** If you are subtracting, start by removing the tens being subtracted from the bigger number and then attempt to remove the appropriate number of ones. For example, if you are subtracting 23 from 45, then there are enough ones and you are done. If there are not enough ones, such as if you are subtracting 28 from 45, then discuss how one of the groups of tens needs to be broken up and included with the ones. The original grouping of 45 as 4 tens and 5 ones becomes a grouping of 3 tens and 15 ones. This is also called regrouping.\n"

"**Use expanded form:** Use objects for double-digit adding and subtracting until your child thoroughly understands the process and why regrouping makes sense when it is needed. At this point, move to representing the adding and subtracting with numbers written in expanded form. When working with numbers in expanded form, the process and the steps are exactly the same as they were when you were working with groups of tens and ones – and that is the point.\n"

"\n"
"**No remainder:** Division problems where the divisor goes in evenly without a remainder are mostly done by your child recognizing the corresponding multiplication fact. For example, if they are asked to divide 36 by 4, then remembering that 4 times 9 is 36 will get them straight to the answer. However, if that method doesn't work for a given problem, then they should use the next method.\n"
"\n"
"**Guessing and skip counting:** Suppose your child is asked to divide 29 by 4. Your child will not find 29 among their multiplication facts involving 4, so they will want to find a result that is less than 29 that does work. Have your child guess at a multiple of 4 that is less than 29. They might guess 24, which is 4 times 6. They can then skip count forward until they bump into 29. In this case that will mean moving forward to 28, which is 4 times 7. Seeing that they have to stop there, they have their answer that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\n"
"\n"
"**Checking the answer:** Checking their answers is a good habit for your child to develop. In this last example, we think we found that 29 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 1. Check this by multiplying 4 times 7 to get 28, and then adding 1 to get 29. So it all checks out!"

"Puzzles are meant to be challenging and to take time, so please don't ruin the fun by telling your child how to do them. These puzzles are chosen so that you can create them easily and then have fun solving them together.\n"
"\n"
"If your child gets stuck on a puzzle, you have several options. You can, of course, give very small hints, if you can think of things that won't give away the puzzle. You can suggest looking at smaller or simpler versions of the puzzle. Encourage your child to be bold in their ideas, even if sometimes they lead to dead ends. We all learn a lot from our mistakes and dead ends! Let your child know that it is perfectly okay not to solve a puzzle on the first (or second or third) try, and that useful ideas may occur to them if they leave the puzzle alone for a day or two.\n"
"\n"
"These puzzles are meant to be fun and to teach problem solving. One of the greatest mathematical pleasures is that AHA moment, after many false starts and much wrestling with a problem, when the answer is finally discovered – be sure to let your child experience that feeling of discovery as many times as you can!"

"Investigations are meant for your child to play with and think about. Let your child explore these looking for interesting patterns and beautiful relationships. Resist the temptation to unveil what is going on and give the answer. If your child seems to have reached a dead end, suggest that they come back to the investigation at a future time to play with it again.\n"
"\n"
"Many investigations benefit from organizing results, and this is a great thing for you to help your child with. Help them make tables, drawings, or whatever may help them see more easily what is going on. And of course, it is perfectly fine to give them gentle nudges from time to time in the right direction. Remember that your child will learn a lot by developing persistence and learning how to look more deeply at things."
