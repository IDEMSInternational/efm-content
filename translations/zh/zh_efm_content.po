"What a wonderful time watching your young child learn about the world! They are little sponges observing everything going on around them and they can hear you! They play and experiment constantly, making sense of the world and learning how to crawl, walk, talk, and interact with all that they are experiencing.\n"
"\n"
"Mathematics is a natural part of this world they are learning about. No matter what your experiences and feelings about math, this is your chance to make mathematics a playful and fun activity that your family does together.\n"
"\n"
"For now, the main mathematical activity to do together will be exposing your child constantly to mathematical language and ideas. This is mostly just a matter of verbalizing what is going on in your head already. Counting things out loud as you work with them and naming items that your child plays with is what gets everything rolling.\n"
"\n"
"Have fun! This is an amazing time for your family!"

"看着您的孩子学习并了解这个世界是多么欢愉快乐的时光! 他们就像是小海绵，时刻观察着围绕在周围所发生的一切事情和变化，包括听到您！他们每时每刻都在体验这个世界，在体验和和玩耍中学习如何爬，走，说，并且与周围存在的一切事物互动。\n"
"\n"
"数学正是孩子们学习的有关自然世界的一部分。无论您对数学的感受或者经验如何，这将是您开始将数学变成一个有趣的家庭娱乐项目的好机会。\n"
"\n"
"这些主要的数字游戏和活动能够让您的孩子充分地接触数学语言和数学概念。基本上，请将您脑海中想象的事物词语化。当你和孩子一起玩耍时，请大声计数，并将孩子玩耍的物品命名。\n"
"\n"
"玩得开心！这将是您和家人的美好时光！"

"* Verbalize math - You do math all the time in your head – include your child by saying those thoughts out loud to your child all the time. \n"
"* Point and describe - When you talk about something, point to it and then talk about it. If your child is ready, ask questions about it. \n"
"* Expose - Your child is learning by being exposed to things. Your child will probably not un- derstand things initially, but by frequent exposure your child will pick up on the patterns and learn what is going on. \n"
"* Count everything out loud. Count up and down. Include 0 sometimes. \n"
"* Objects have properties that can be named, described, compared, and discussed. Those properties lead to discoveries of natural and human-made patterns."
