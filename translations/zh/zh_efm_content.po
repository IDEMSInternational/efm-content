"Your child can now count to 100! They can comfortably do mental single-digit addition and subtraction. They can also count or skip count up or down by any number, and tied to that skill is their ability to add or subtract a single-digit number with a double-digit number. They can compare two double-digit numbers, and they have a beginning sense of place value with 10’s and 1’s.\n"
"\n"
"As their skip counting is improving, they are also developing skills with multiplying by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. The idea of even and odd numbers now makes a lot more sense to them.\n"

"* Counting to 200 – Introduce the 100’s place by looking at the numbers from 100 to 200.\n"

"* Expanded Form and Place Value – This is a foundational skill, so it will be reinforced further.\n"
"* Double-digit Addition and Subtraction – Skip counting will help make this seem effortless.\n"
"* All Single-digit Multiplication – It is time to fill in the missing gaps for 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n"
"* Rectangle Area is Length x Width – This is an important idea in its own right. This fact will also provide many opportunities for fun games and puzzles involving multiplication and factoring.\n"
"* Factoring – Your child will learn the beauty of how numbers break apart into factors. 1 is a unit. A number bigger than 1 only divisible by 1 and itself is prime. A number bigger than 1 that is not prime is composite. 3 **squared** is 3 × 3. 3 **cubed** is 3 × 3 × 3. And 3 raised to a power means to multiply 3 by itself that many times - for example, 3 to the fourth is 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.\n"
"* Factors, Divisors, and Multiples – 3 divides evenly into 12. That makes 3 a factor or divisor of 12, and 12 a multiple of 3. 3 is a common factor of 12 and 15, and 12 is a common multiple of 4 and 6.\n"
"* Single-digit Division – Your child will learn division indirectly in the form of finding a missing factor in a multiplication problem.\n"
"* Fact Families for Multiplication and Division – We'll reinforce the connection between these two operations. For example, 2 × 5 = 10, 5 × 2 = 10, 10 / 2 = 5, and 10 / 5 = 2 form a fact family."

"* 展开式和位值 – 这是一项基础技能，需要不断练习。\n"
"* 两位数加减法 – 跳数可以帮我们轻松进行两位数的加减。\n"
"* 一位数乘法 – 是时候学习 6、7、8 和 9 乘法了。\n"
"* 矩形面积＝长×宽 – 这个本身就是一个重要的数学概念。这个知识点还能为很多有趣的游戏和涉及乘法与因式分解的谜题提供诀窍。\n"
"* 因式分解 – 你的孩子将学习数字如何分解成因数的奇妙之处。1 是一个单位。大于 1 且仅能被 1 和自身整除的自然数是质数；大于 1 且不是质数的数是合数。3 的平方是 3 x 3。3 的立方是 3 x 3 x 3。3 的幂是指将 3 乘以自身很多次——例如，3 的四次方是 3 x 3 x 3 x 3。\n"
"* 因数、约数和倍数 – 3 可以整除 12。这使得 3 成为 12 的因数或约数，而 12 是 3 的倍数。3 是 12 和 15 的公因数，而 12 是 4 和 6 的公倍数。\n"
"* 一位数除法 – 你的孩子将通过在乘法问题中找出缺失的因数来间接学习除法。\n"
"* 乘法和除法的运算族 – 我们将在该阶段加强这两种运算之间的联系。例如，2 x 5 = 10、5 x 2 = 10、10 ÷ 2 = 5 和 10 ÷ 5 = 2 构成了一个乘除法运算族（一组相关的数学算式，使用相同的数字，但运算不同）。"

Once a counter has made it all the way across the board, it becomes a king and can then move forward or backward one row after that. An opponent's piece is taken by landing on it.

"Without analyzing anything, this game is enjoyable to play and it provides good practice with adding or subtracting 1 and 2. We could leave it at that. However, it is also a great example of two problem solving techniques that you can show to your child when they are ready: 1) learning from simpler examples, and 2) looking for patterns.\n"

"Any of the versions can be studied this way. Let’s look at one: Subtracting starting at 10 and whoever gets 0 wins. The hard part of this game is that 10 is so far from 0. So, let’s look at a simpler version. When children are asked to do this, they often suggest starting at 5 or 6 - it seems absurd to them to start at 1, but that is actually what they should do! Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position. If the count is 4, you will win because you will subtract 1 and put your opponent in a losing position. Continuing in this way, build up a table of results:\n"

"这款游戏无需进行任何分析，它本身就很有趣，而且您的孩子可以通过该游戏来练习1和2的加减法。除此之外，当您的孩子准备好时您可以通过这个例子展示两个解决问题的好技巧：1）从更简单的示例中学习， 2）寻找规律。\n"
"\n"
"该游戏的任何版本都可以通过这种方式进行学习。让我们看一个例子：从10开始做减法，得到0的人获得胜利。这个游戏的难点是10离0太远了。所以，让我们看一个更简单的版本。当要求孩子这样做时，他们通常建议从5或6开始（从1开始似乎是荒谬的，但这实际上是他们应该做的！）通常最好是尽可能从简单的开始（这意味着从1开始）。如果这是您先走并且计数为1，那么通过减1您就可以获胜。再试试别的数字。如果计数为2，您可以通过减2获胜。如果计数为3，那么您必输无疑，无论是减去1还是2，您都将对手置于必胜之地。如果计数为4，您将获胜。因为您将减去1，并将对手置于必败之地。以此类推，我们可以建立如下表格：\n"

"This table makes it obvious that there is a repeating pattern of 3. When starting at 10, you should want to go first and subtract 1. What is satisfying about this is that, once you decide to look at simpler versions of the problem, the analysis is quick and easy - no tricky analysis needed. Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n"
"\n"
"But wait, there is one last question. Why is there a repeating pattern of 3? Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1."
msgstr ""
"从该表可以看出规律：每三个连续的数字对应的结果都是相同的。所以每当从10开始，您就应该先减去1。让人感到欣慰的是，无论问题多复杂，一旦您从问题的简单版本着手，您就可以轻松快捷地寻找到规律而无需进行复杂的分析。现在您已成为尼姆游戏大师了，从任何数量开始该您都知道该怎么做！这个基本游戏的任何版本都同样容易分析。\n"
"\n"
"那么现在问题来了：为什么重复的输赢规律是数以3计？一旦一个玩家被困在了“输”的数字（即是3的倍数）上，那么此后的每一回合两个玩家所减数字之和都可以是3。因为如果占下风的玩家减去1，则占上风的玩家可以减去2；如果占下风的玩家减去2，那么占上风的玩家可以减去1。这样一来占下风的玩家会一直被困在“输”的数字上。"

Similarly, for a circle with 9 dots, why is only one string needed to skip by 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8, but 3 strings are needed for 3 and 6?

"Take this long list and count the number of inversions in it. When a number earlier in the list is larger than a number later in the list, this is called an inversion. If the number of inversions is an even number, then the puzzle is solvable. If it is an odd number, it is not.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, take the 3 by 3 puzzle at the start of this discussion. Start by moving the 4 up to the second row. Then the list is: 6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7. There are 10 inversions in this list: 6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, and 5 3. There are an even number of inversions, so the puzzle is solvable.\n"
"\n"
"Why does this rule work? I won’t drag you through a detailed analysis. The key idea is to keep track of the number of inversions every time you make a move. It turns out that, if you adjust for the hole being in the last row, the number of inversions must always change by an even number after any move. Consequently, if the number of inversions starts as an odd number, it can never get down to 0 inversions."

"很好，您现在已经掌握了一种简单的方法来解决拼图。那么下一个问题来了：我怎样才能看一下拼图就知道它是否可以解决呢？\n"
"\n"
"为了使答案的描述尽可能简单，如有必要，请快速执行一些操作，以将空白正方形放在底行中。接下来，在长列表中列出行的列表——第一行列在第一位，第二行列在第二行，依此类推，最后一行列在最后。当您列出最后一行时，请忽略空的正方形。\n"
"\n"
"拿这个长长的清单，计算其中的反转次数。当列表中较早的数字大于列表中较晚的数字时，这称为取反。如果求反数是偶数，那么这个游戏就可以解决。如果是奇数，则不是。\n"
"\n"
"以本讨论开始时的3 x 3拼图为例。首先将4移至第二行。然后，列表为：6 1 2 4 8 5 3 7。此列表中有10对数字是顺序颠倒的：6 1, 6 2, 6 4, 6 5, 6 3, 4 3, 8 5, 8 3, 8 7, 和5 3。因为颠倒数字的对数是偶数，所以这个游戏是可以解决的。\n"
"\n"
"为什么该规则有效？我不会在这里进行详细的推论。关键思想是每次移动时都要留意颠倒数字的对数。事实证明，如果您把空格放到最后一行中，那么在进行任何一步移动之后，颠倒数字的对数始终以偶数变化。因此，如果颠倒数字的对数是奇数，那么这个拼图永远不可能按顺序排列。"
