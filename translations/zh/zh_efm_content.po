For example, create 50 + 3 for 53, 30 + 0 for 30, and 0 + 7 for 7. Shuffle those two decks of 20 cards together. Two cards match when a regular number is paired with its expanded form."

"**The setup:** This game is lightly inspired by checkers. Each player has 10 counters. The counters are numbered from 1 to 10, with the “10” counter marked with 10 and 11. The counters start on the end rows of a 100-chart - one player on squares 1 to 10 and the other on squares 91 to 100.\n"
"\n"
"**How to play:** Initially, counters can only move “forward” one row onto any multiple of the number(s) on the marker they choose – for the player starting on 1 to 10, forward means larger numbers, and for the player starting on 91 to 100, forward means smaller numbers. Once a counter has made it all the way across the board, it becomes a king and can then move forward or backward one row after that. An opponent's piece is taken by landing on it. A player’s piece cannot double up with another of the same player’s pieces.\n"

"**游戏规则:** 最初，棋子只能根据所选标记上的数字 (或数字) 的任何倍数向前移动一行——对于从1到10开始的玩家，向前意味着更大的数字，对于从91 到 100 开始的玩家，向前意味着更小的数字。一旦棋子穿过整个棋盘，它就变成“王”，然后可以向前或向后移动一行。 通过落在对手的棋子上可以吃掉对方的棋子。玩家的棋子不能与相同玩家的其他棋子重复放置。\n"

Often it is best to start as simply as possible - that means starting at 1. If it is your move and the count is 1, you win. Do the next few. If the count is 2, you win. If the count is 3, you must lose - whether you subtract 1 or 2, you will give your opponent a winning position.

Now you are a Master at this game and you know what to do starting at any number! Any version of this basic game is just as easy to analyze.\n"

Once one player is stuck on a losing number which is a multiple of three, every pair of moves after that can be made to add up to 3 - if the losing player subtracts 1 the other player subtracts 2, and if the losing player subtracts 2 the other player subtracts 1."

"This is a special case of the last idea. Put some dots, say 8 or 9, evenly spaced on a circle. Your child can play with creating different patterns by connecting the dots in order, or connecting every second dot, or every third dot. To make it easier to do different experiments, use push pins in a piece of cardboard or wood and then use string between the push pins.\n"
"\n"
"If your child is intrigued by the patterns that are produced, you can look at questions such as: For a circle with 8 dots, why is only one string needed to skip by 1, 3, 5, or 7, but 2 or 4 strings are needed for skipping 2, 4, or 6. Similarly, for a circle with 9 dots, why is only one string needed to skip by 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8, but 3 strings are needed for 3 and 6? It’s too young to understand the idea that 2, 4, and 6 have a factor in common with 8, and 3 and 6 have a factor in common in 9 - however, seeing the patterns may plant the seeds for later ideas."

"这是上面提到的最后一个方案的特例。将一定数量的点（比如说8或者9个）均匀地分布在一个圆上，然后让您的孩子按数字的顺序连接各个点，或者每隔一个或者两个点来连接。如果想让这个游戏进行地更加容易，您可以在一块纸板或木头上钉上图钉来代表各个点，然后用细线在图钉之间编织图案。\n"
"\n"
"如果您的孩子对他制作的图案感兴趣，不妨进一步去思考一下这些问题：对于一个有8个点的圆，为什么通过每跳1、3、5或7步的连接方法只需要用到一条线就可以把所有点连接满，然而如果是，每跳2、4或者6步则需要用到2条甚至6条线。类似地，对于一个有9个点的圆，为什么每跳1，2、4、5、7或8步连接只需要用到1条线，而对于3或者6步连接则需要用到3条。虽然对于小孩子来说它们还太小，大概难以理解2、4、6与8有共同的因数，而3、6和9有共同的因数——但是，这个游戏能给他们日后的思维方式埋下启蒙的种子。"
