"Here is a quick list of topics that will be covered in this Stage.\n"
"\n"
"• Counting forward and backward to 10. Don’t ignore backward counting – it is important for understanding number relationships as well as being an aid for subtraction.\n"
"• Include 0 in your counting sometimes. Including 0 now makes it a familiar number and keeps it from feeling exotic.\n"
"• Reasoning with properties and numbers. Understanding properties and reasoning with them is a key part of developing mathematical ability.\n"
"• Deepening understanding of shapes, especially circles, triangles, and squares. Keep using descriptive shape names as your child interacts with them.\n"
"• Comparing and ordering numbers. How quantities compare and interact with each other is central to understanding them.\n"
"• One more, one less, two more, two less. These concepts are relatively easy to pick up, and they will form the basis for addition and subtraction.\n"
"• Learning to use manipulatives, especially fingers, to understand adding and subtracting. Adding and subtracting 0.\n"
"• Subtracting a number from itself."

"您的孩子將在接下來的幾個月里將學到很多東西——不僅僅是數到10以上。以下列出了這個階段將涵蓋的一些主題。\n"
"\n"
"* 10以內的正數和倒數。不要忽視倒數，它對孩子理解數字關系以及作為減法的輔助是很重要的。\n"
"* 將0包含在數數中。現在在數數中包括0可以讓孩子熟悉它，避免以後對0感覺陌生。\n"
"* 使用屬性和數字進行推理。理解其屬性並使用它進行推理是培養數學能力的關鍵。\n"
"* 加深對形狀的理解，特別是圓形、三角形和正方形。在孩子與這些形狀互動時，繼續使用描述性的名稱。\n"
"* 比較和排序數字。數量如何相互比較和相互作用是理解它們的核心\n"
"* 多一、少一、多兩、少兩。這些概念相對容易理解，它們是加法和減法的基礎。\n"
"* 學會使用可視化工具來理解加法和減法，尤其是手指。加零和減零。\n"
"* 用一個數減去自己。"

The distance from 13 to 8 is the distance from 13 to 10 plus the distance from 10 to 8. Using this, 13 - 8 becomes (13 - 10) + (10 - 8) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n"
